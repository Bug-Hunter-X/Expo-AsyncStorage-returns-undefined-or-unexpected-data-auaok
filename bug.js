This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and it's related to how AsyncStorage handles data persistence and interaction with other parts of your application.  The root cause is often a race condition or improper handling of asynchronous operations. For example, trying to read data before it's written or modifying data while another operation is in progress can lead to unpredictable outcomes. This may manifest as `undefined` values being returned unexpectedly or data corruption. The error might not always be immediately obvious, appearing inconsistently or only under specific usage patterns.
